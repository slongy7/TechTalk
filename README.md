## Description
This app is designed to be a social media application specifically made for people and professionals.  The plan is to have a personal profile in which you can make posts, read othe people's posts, make friends and connections, and continue to learn.  The version 2 version is planning on having a job board API, and a chat function as well.

## Technologies Used
Bulma, Graphql, Apollo Client, React, Express

## Bugs
We had full plans to add the jobs API to version 1, but we ran into some implementation issues and were unable to do it in time.  

Bulma isn't an easy frontend component to use with JavaScript, so we had to work around that a little bit.
